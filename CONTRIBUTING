thanks for taking an interest in this crazy project!

this is experimental free software. it will probably require some fiddling with dependencies and code tampering in order to run in any setup but the original lab boxes it was developed for. you can contact me for assistance, questions or ideas to share at yaco@yaco.net.

if you find any bugs, have an idea for enhancements or features, you can use the meta-project issue tracker at github: https://github.com/yacosp/oveja-electrica/issues. you can also send me an email to yaco@yaco.net, will try to reply as soon as possible.

if you want help making the thing run, bear in mind that this _is_ a very experimental project, and patience is required. the DEPENDENCIES file might help a bit, and i can probably lend you a hand if you send me an email.

if you make modifications, fork the project, or use parts of it for your own crazy one, i would really appreciate knowing about it... may even find time to lend a hand!
